🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, trends, and anomalies from the data to better understand the factors influencing passenger survival.

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`      | Good — you have the README for documentation!                                           |
| `Task5.png`      | Likely a saved plot or a summary image. 👍                                               |
| `tested.csv`     | Probably your Titanic dataset (you named it `tested.csv`) — maybe correct it to `test.csv` or `titanic.csv` for clarity? |
| `tsak5.py`       | **Typo** — should be `task5.py` instead of `tsak5.py`.                                   |

# 🔥 Recommendations for improvement:

1. **Fix filename typo**:  
   ➔ Rename `tsak5.py` ➔ `task5.py`  
   (Correct spelling will make your project look more professional.)

2. **Optional: Rename dataset**:  
   ➔ Rename `tested.csv` ➔ `titanic.csv` (only if it makes sense for your project.)

3. **Update README.md**:
   - Reflect correct filenames inside your instructions (mention `task5.py` instead of `tsak5.py`).
   - Mention the `.png` file if it is a result plot or output image (example: "Task5.png contains an overview plot.").

## 📂 Files

- `task5.py` : Python script for EDA
- `tested.csv` : Titanic dataset (you may rename it `titanic.csv`)
- `Task5.png` : Sample visualization/output plot
- `README.md` : Project documentation

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install with:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python task5.py
```

Make sure `tested.csv` is in the same directory.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Females had higher survival chances than males.
- First-class passengers survived more than other classes.
- Higher fares and younger age correlated with survival.
- Cabin data has lots of missing values.

---

## 📚 Dataset

- Titanic dataset from Kaggle or local.
